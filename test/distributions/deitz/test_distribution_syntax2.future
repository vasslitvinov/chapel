bug: Privatized class indices need a distinguished value to represent nil ...

... and uninitialized privatized classes need to be initialized to a valid value.

Following the introduction of calls to user default constructors, variables of
_distribution type are default-initialized so their _value field (when
privatized) is zero.  This is then treated as a privatized class index, so
(apparently) multiple uninitialized variables of distribution type will all
point to the same structure.

The error manifests when assignment is used to update one of these.  The
assignment operator (ChapelArray.chpl:1588) refuses to update the domain field
in a distribution if it already has a length.

This problem may also be present in the implementation of privatized domain
classes.
