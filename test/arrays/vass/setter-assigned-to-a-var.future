bug: memory corruption at run time when an array is return from a 'var' function

Currently this program results in memory corruption.
Upon a short investigation, the corruption is due to 'anArray' being
autoDestroy'ed one time too many in accessorFun().

If we remove 'var' in accessorFun's header, the array is still returned
by reference, and memory corruption goes away.
