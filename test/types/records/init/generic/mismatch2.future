error message: confusing error for mismatched generic type assignment

This test is complaining about an assignment from real to integer,
apparently from within a compiler-generated assignment operator,
suggesting that we're using assignment where we should simply be using
initialization.  I believe the error message should be complaining
about an (initialization) assignment between A(real) and A(int).
