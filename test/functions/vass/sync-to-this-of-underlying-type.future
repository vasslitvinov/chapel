feature request: should the value of a sync/single variable be read when it is the receiver calling a method on the underlying type?

For uniformity, when I pass a "sync int"-typed variable to a function
expecting an "int", esp. by 'in' intent, I assume that the variable
will be readFE()-read, regardless whether it is passed to the 'this'
formal or not.

However, the compiler currently has a special case that bypasses
readFE when a sync variable is passed to the 'this' formal.
while performing readFE for non-receiver formals. This seems incorrect to me.

Ditto single types.
