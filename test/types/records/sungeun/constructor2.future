bug: Initialization is not assignment

In the declaration
  var r: myR = new myR();
the expression to the right of the '=' is initially treated as an initializer
expression and the '=' itself is treated as initialization, not assignment.
That is the correct interpretation.

Currently, however, the normalize pass converts the
variable-declaration-with-initializer into an uninitialized variable declaration
followed by an assignment.  The code that is produced is correct from the point
of view of establishing class invariants and maintaining memory correctly.
However, the duplicate "hi" lines in the .bad file show that the default
constructor is getting called twice.

If the above expression were representing declaration-with-initialization, then
the default constructor would be called only once (in the evaluation of the "new
myR()" expression).  Then the copy-constructor should be called to initialize
the variable "r".  The assignment operator for type myR should not be called by
this program at all.
