# Example setenv script that illustrates a possible solution to
#   https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/9943,
# using build_configs.py with a custom setenv script (ie, this file).

# This file builds a trivial array of Chapel configurations, and
# uses a very simple style of bash scripting.
# It is meant as a setenv tutorial only.

# How to use this example:
#
#   git clone ssh://git@github.com/chapel-lang/chapel.git
#   cd chapel/util/build_configs
#
#   # build Chapel with and without gasnet
#   ./setenv-example-1.bash
#
#   # run a test with and without gasnet (optional)
#   source ../setchplenv.bash
#
#   export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
#   export CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=smp
#   chpl -o hello6 $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6*.chpl
#   ./hello6 -nl 2
#
#   export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
#   export CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=udp
#   export GASNET_SPAWNFN=L
#   chpl -o hello6 $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6*.chpl
#   ./hello6 -nl 2
#
#   export CHPL_COMM=none
#   chpl -o hello6 $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6*.chpl
#   ./hello6

    #   build config, then source's this script, and finally runs Chapel make.

    #   This script can make arbitrary changes to the environment seen by Chapel make.
    #   It can also skip the Chapel make command entirely, by doing a shell exit.
