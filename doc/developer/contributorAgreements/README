This directory contains Chapel's Apache-2.0-based contributor license
agreements (CLAs) which serve as a precondition for committing code to
the Chapel repository.  There are two versions:

* chapel-ccla.pdf : For corporations (or other organizations) in which
                    one person is responsible for granting the rights
                    for other contributors

* chapel-icla.pdf : For individual contributors
