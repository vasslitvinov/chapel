bug: 'sync' and 'single' should be allowed only on scalar types

This is our current thinking, and Brad's rationale for it: Imagine we
allowed 'sync' on aggregate types. Then, when is the full/empty bit
set for a multiplicity of values?  When accessing any of them?  Only
when accessing one of them?  How is the bookkeeping done?  Combined
with a lack of compelling use cases.

"Scalar" excludes string and complex.

This is the same as
  parallel/sync/diten/syncArrOfSync.future

P.S. Currently sync and single are allowed on sync/single types,
by virtue of the latter being implemented as classes.
Are we OK with that?
